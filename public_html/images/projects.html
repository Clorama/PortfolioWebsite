<h3>(in order of importance)</h3>
        	<ol>
        		<li><b>Learning Website Design-HTML,CSS, and Javascript</b>
        		</li><p> I'm currently learning HTML and CSS from a course available on Skillshare.com. You can see my progress via this portfolio website! I am also working on another website that will be more tailored to my personal brand called "It's Clo!"</p>
        		
        		<li><b>Life Coach Certification</b></li>
        		<p>I came across a great opportunity to enroll in a life coach certification course. I'm already trusted as a go to person amongst my circle of friends for advice and I notice that I really enjoy helping others figure out how to overcome their personal fears to go after what they truly want. By the end of January 2014, I will have completed my certification and will begin practicing as a Life Design personal coach.</p>

                <li><b>Videos of my Travels</b></li>
                <p>On July 27th, 2012, I bought a one-way ticket and left California to backpack Europe. I discovered a lot about myself on this trip and I'm so glad to have gotten the urge to take video over pictures. I have always had a passion for putting videos together, and I will develop those skills via putting my videos together for my trip. 

                <li><b>Graphic Design Programs</b></li>
                <p>I'm currently learning any and all programs that have to do with graphic design. I didn't even know this was a career in itself until early 2013 after I arrived in NYC and met a few aspiring and current graphic designers. I can't really afford the study programs so I've been utilizing resources to learn them on my own in the meantime while I am saving up, those include: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Adobe Aftereffects, etc.</p>

                <li><b>Fine Art</b></li>
                <p>Painting recreationally with acrylic on canvas is what kicked off my whole life adventure in transitioning to the creative field. I want to stay loyal to these roots and have made a goal to complete 25 paintings, one every week for the next 25 weeks and then blogging about each one. <a href="">Check them out here:</a> </p>

                <li><b>Personal Brand and Web Presence</b></li>
                <p>For those who are interested in working with me or just would like to be connected and/or stay updated on my work, <a href="">check out my other pages: </a></p>
