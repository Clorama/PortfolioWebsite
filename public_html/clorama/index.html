        <center><p>I am recently transitioning into the world of Graphic Design and Art and the world of New York City! I'm a native Californian with a strong nonprofit and public policy background and a huge heart for ART. And most of all, I'm a human who cares about the world and wants to explore all that it has to offer while helping to make it a better place. I enjoy painting, sketching, blogging, meditating, yoga-ing, traveling, and life on the side.</p>

        <p> My life mission is to utilize the gifts that God gave me to contribute as much positive things that I can to this earth.</p></center>
        <p><center><b>With this website, my blog, and my work, I am hoping to inspire others and to continue to <i>be inspired</i> by others on this same path.</b></center></p>

            <p><b>RECENT UPDATE 9.25 </b><br> I am currently learning HTML and CSS Coding (to build and develop this site and hopefully others soon!). I am also currently undertaking courses in Photoshop, Web Design and other useful programs.</p>
