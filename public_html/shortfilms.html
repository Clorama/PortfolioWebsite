        <p>A woman journeys atop a hill to remember the loss and the events that took place in the US where she grew up. She reflects on the historic damage done and the devastating losses she experienced. As a result of this tragedy that takes place in the USA, it has a massive global impact that finally moves global leaders and the world's people to make changes with the way countries resolve conflict today. </p>

         <p>She reflects on these events and how it served that tragedy seemed to be the only real catalyst for the world to see past differences and find common ground in their aspirations for a more peaceful world. How social media became the unexpected factor for the world to realize their power to effect change. Pressuring the political structures to adopt produce special powers to the UN to create new international institutions and enforce innovative alternatives for peaceful conflict resolution.</p>

         <p>This is a speculative design video experimenting with cinematic features of drama and and theatrical traits for the goal of optimal emotional impact. It serves to evoke discussion and debate about our current capacity to change, addressing the threat of our lives being at the governments mercy, and the role of social media's influence on global politics.

                <p>This video gives a glimpse of her trying to come to grips with this and reveals just how selfies have become so entrenched with our human need to share experiences and connect with others in the digital world while ironically, increasing our discomfort to reach out to those around us in the real world. Unable to capture her experience via selfies, she has no way of distracting herself from the feelings of isolation and disconnectedness she is now left with.</p>

                <p>This video was assigned to Joy and I during a Filmmaking Workshop provided for our MA Interaction Design Communication course at UAL: London College of Communication. We had 24 hours to come up with a storyline taken from newspaper headlines, storyboard, film and edit the film in its entirety.</p>

                <p>Solo traveled to New Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, and Chandigarh for a week and a half. Spending the last few days at my best friend's wedding. This video captures day 2 and day 3 in New Delhi and Agra.</p>

                <p>This was filmed using a GoPro HERO 3+ and some clips also taken from my Samsung Galaxy S2 that I badly need to upgrade.</p>
